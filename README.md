# jira-dashboard
a very simple cli interface to replace the godawful jira dashboard gui


*NB*: you'll need to add your credentials to `libdash/creds.py`, like so:
```
USERNAME = "sallywhateverface"
PASSWORD = "a very secure password, on which your company's security depends"
URL = "https://the.url.to_your_jira.site"
```

If you fork this repo, of course, it goes without saying that you should
ensure that creds.py is in your .gitignore.
